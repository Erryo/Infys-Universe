          needâ€”from my school stuff to my side-projects and beyond. Building this site, if you
          can call it that,serves as an escape from reality,
          a creative and intellectual space where I can explore and innovate.

          I created Infy's Universe to be a comprehensive platform for all the things I 
          need and am passionate about. It includes my school schedule, learning        
          resources for web development, and a variety of personal projects. The name   
          "Infy's Universe" comes from my nickname "Infy" and symbolizes a space that   
          contains everything(<font class="text-sm"> well almost everything </font>)  
          important to me, much like a universe contains everything within it. Although 
          it is primarily for my use, I also see it as a potential addition to my       
          resume, showcasing my skills and projects, someday, hopefully.

       I am Marius Trifan, a 15-year-old student from the Republic of Moldova, but
       &nbsp;for learning, I have been passionate about exploring new things from a young
       age. My journey began with gaming, which evolved into a passion for game
       development and programming. I have taught myself various programming
       concepts and experimented with numerous projects, constantly fueling my
       desire to learn and innovate. Academically, I have excelled in science and
       have a deep interest in understanding how the world works. My ultimate goal
       is to become a software engineer, focusing on problem-solving
